# Rental Management System (MERN Stack)

A full-stack rental management application built for the Odoo Hackathon. This platform serves as a two-sided marketplace, allowing **Lenders** to list products for rent and **Customers** to browse, request quotations, and rent items through a complete order fulfillment workflow.

## âœ¨ Key Features

### ðŸ‘¤ Customer Features
* **Authentication:** Secure JWT-based registration, login, and password reset (via OTP).
* **Product Browsing:** View all listed products with search, sorting, and category filtering.
* **Quotation System:** Instead of a simple "buy," customers request a quotation by selecting products, rental dates, and a delivery method (self-pickup or home delivery).
* **Order Tracking:** A dedicated "My Orders" page to track the status of all rentals (`Pending`, `Quotation Approved`, `Reserved`, `Payment Request`, `PickedUp`, `Returned`).
* **Interactive Workflow:** Customers can "Accept" approved quotations to reserve an item.
* **Payment:** A dedicated payment page to pay for reserved items.
* **Profile Management:** Customers can edit their profile details and change their password.

* **Dynamic Dashboard:** A comprehensive dashboard with live analytics on revenue, total rentals, top products, and top customers. All data is filterable by date and searchable.

* **Quotation Management:** A "Rental" page to view and manage all active quotations.
